# Skill Tree System (Lite)

This repository contains the **full source project** for a masterclass where we rebuild a **Lite version** of a 5-star **Skill Tree Pro** system from Fab, entirely in **Blueprints** using Unreal Engine.

The goal of this course is not just to *end up* with a skill tree—but to understand **how and why** a polished, production-ready system is designed, structured, optimized, and made modular.

## About the project

**Enginuity**, the creator of **Skill Tree Pro**, has created this tutorial series to give back to the community. The course is designed to give developers the opportunity to:

- Build a **polished, game-ready system** themselves  
- Follow along with my **thought process and design flow**  
- Learn **advanced but practical techniques** used in real projects  
- Build a **Lite version** of the product rather than purchase the premium asset  

No C++ is required — everything is **Blueprint-only**.

## 🧠 What I have Built & Learnt

By following this course, I have built and learnt:

- A **procedurally-generated yet extremely customizable skill tree**
- A **robust underlying skilling system**
  - Persistent saving
  - Crash-proof design
- **Advanced UI materials and animations** resulting in a polished, modern UI
- A smooth **pan, zoom, and autofocus** approach for UI navigation
- **Fully data-driven architecture**
- **True modular system design**
  - Clean hooks to plug the system into *any* game
- **Optimization best practices**, including:
  - Soft object batch loading
  - Signed Distance Field (SDF) material optimization
  - Dependency control for maximum scalability

This course focuses on **real production patterns**, not just “getting something working.”
